This folder contains the main entry point for running the Starter Kit node as an application.

## What Does It Do?

- Parses command-line arguments (such as data path and secret key).
- Initializes the Iroh node, which manages networking, storage, and cryptographic identity.
- Starts the frontend (if enabled).
- Sets up the HTTP API server using Axum and the router module.
- Listens for incoming API requests on `http://localhost:4000`.
- Handles graceful shutdown on Ctrl+C.

## How to Run

1. **First-time setup:**  
   Generate a secret key by running:
   ```
   cargo run
   ```
   Save the secret key displayed in the output.

2. **Start the node:**  
   Use your data directory and secret key:
   ```
   cargo run -- --path <user_data_dir_path> --secret-key <secret_key>
   ```

3. **Access the API:**  
   The server will be available at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
